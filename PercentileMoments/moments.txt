The first moment is the mean.

The second moment is the variance.

The third moment is "skew"
-  How 'lopsided is the distribution?
- A distribution with a longer tail on the left will be skewed left, and  have a negative skew.
- A distribution with a longer tail on the right will be skewed right, and  have a positive skew.

The fourth moment is "kurtosis"
- How thick is the tail, and how sharp is the peak, compared to a normal distribution?
- example: Higher peaks have higher kurtosis.
