Standard Deviation is just the square root of the variance.

Variance(sigma square) = 5.04
Standard Deviation(sigma) = square root of 5.04 = 2.24

Standard Deviation of (1,4,5,4,8) is 2.24

This is usually used as a way to identify outliers. 
Data points that lie more than one standard deviation from the mena can be considered unusual.

You can talk about how extreme a data point is by talking about " how many sigmas" away from the mean it is.
